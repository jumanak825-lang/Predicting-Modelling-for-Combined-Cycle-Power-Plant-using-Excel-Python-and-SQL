# Predicting-Modelling-for-Combined-Cycle-Power-Plant-using-Excel-Python-and-SQL
Built a predictive model for a combined-cycle power plant using SQL to clean and analyze 9,500+ records. Improved accuracy from linear regression to XGBoost (96%). Identified temperature and vacuum effects on output and proposed data-driven strategies enabling major fuel-cost savings.
